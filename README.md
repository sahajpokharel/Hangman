# hangman
This C++ program is a straightforward implementation of the classic Hangman game. It begins by selecting a random word from a text file named words.txt, which contains a list of words, one per line. The game prompts the user to guess letters one by one, displaying underscores for each letter in the word and updating the display as correct guesses are made. Incorrect guesses are tracked and shown to the player. The program includes a simple text-based Hangman drawing that evolves with each incorrect guess, progressing from an empty scaffold to a complete hangman figure, providing visual feedback on the number of wrong attempts. It checks if the word file is accessible and contains sufficient words, displaying an error message and exiting if there are issues. User input is processed to update the game state and handle repeated wrong guesses. The game concludes when the player either guesses all the letters correctly or accumulates too many incorrect guesses, resulting in a loss. This program serves as a good example of basic file handling, random number generation, and interactive console game development in C++.
